Are children's nightmares a reflection of their real life and psychological experiences or is their brain playing games. In this project I analyzed a data set that includes variables such as age, gender, nightmare frequency and content, sleep patterns, recent life changes, parental observations, psychological issues at school and other factor that showcase the correlation and reasoning behind children nightmares between the ages 4-10.

# Questions + Predictions:

1.  **How frequently do nightmares occur among different age groups?**

    *I predict that kids who are older (\>7) will experience nightmares more frequently than those who are younger (\<6).*

2.  **Is there a difference in nightmare frequency between Males and Females, does this difference have anything to do with Psychological pressure/ issues at school?**

    *I predict that there wont be a significant difference in nightmare frequency between genders and therefore not much of a difference in psychological problems at school.*

3.  Is there a correlation between nightmare frequency, and sleeping patterns?

4.  Is there a correlation between nightmare frequency, content and recent life changes?

5.  Is there a correlation between sleeping environment and nightmare content?

6.  How does the severity of psychological issues experianced bt the child impact the severity/content of their dream?
