Hi! Iâ€™m Valeria Hernandez Lozano, a sophomore at Dominican University majoring in Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering. I love building things, taking on challenges, and exploring different things. This summer, I was able to take part in an R programming and data analysis one-week workshop at Dominican, and although these were topics I didn't expect to have an interest in, I enjoyed learning more about these skills and how they are essential for problem-solving and analyzing data.
